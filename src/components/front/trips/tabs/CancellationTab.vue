                    THIRD PARTY BOOKINGS- Certain sites require a Credit Card to
                    Guarantee the reservation. If a cancellation should occur,
                    you are subject to a one day rental charge for reservations
                    not cancelled 24 hours in advance. You must contact the
                    third party booking site in order to facilitate the
                    cancelation. PAY NOW RESERVATIONS When you select a Pay Now
                    option, the following will apply. Reservations will be
                    honored for the entire day in which the rental is scheduled
                    to be picked up. If you cancel a Pay Now reservation prior
                    to 24 hours before the pick-up time, you will be subject to
                    a $50 cancellation fee. If a Pay Now reservation is
                    cancelled less than 24 hours prior to the pick-up time, you
                    forfeit the entire amount of the reservation.
